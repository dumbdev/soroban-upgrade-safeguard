//! # Soroban Upgrade Safeguard
//!
//! Library for analyzing and validating Soroban smart-contract upgrades on the
//! Stellar network. It detects breaking changes in storage layout, function
//! signatures, and event schemas before an upgrade is deployed.
//!
//! The crate is split into focused modules that form an analysis pipeline:
//!
//! - [`loader`] reads and validates raw WASM binaries from disk.
//! - [`parser`] extracts the Soroban `contractspecv0` custom section and decodes
//!   its XDR entries.
//! - [`spec`] organizes the decoded entries into a [`spec::ContractSpec`].
//! - [`mapper`] builds type-dependency graphs used for cascade detection.
//! - [`diff`] compares two specs and produces a list of findings.
//! - [`report`] aggregates findings into a [`report::SafetyReport`].
//!
//! Most callers only need the two top-level helpers, [`compare_wasm_files`] and
//! [`compare_wasm_bytes`], which run the whole pipeline and return a structured
//! [`report::SafetyReport`]. The individual modules are public so that more
//! specialized tools (CI bots, dashboards, custom checks) can reuse any single
//! stage without shelling out to the CLI binary.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! let report = soroban_upgrade_safeguard::compare_wasm_files(
//!     Path::new("./wasm/v1.wasm"),
//!     Path::new("./wasm/v2.wasm"),
//! )?;
//!
//! if !report.is_safe {
//!     eprintln!("Upgrade is unsafe: {} critical issue(s)", report.critical_count);
//! }
//! # Ok::<(), anyhow::Error>(())
//! ```
